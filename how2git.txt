cd /home/crod569/QM9_project
git status

#  You should see something like:
On branch main
your branch is up to date with 'origin/main'.
Changes not staged for commit:
  (use "git add <file>..." to update what will be committed)
  ...
Untracked files:
  ...
#####
2. Make sure you’re not about to commit huge junk

You want code & config only in this repo, not:

model checkpoints (*.pt, *.pth)

huge data (data/qm9_raw, data/qm9_processed, GAHEAD_runs, etc.)

Google Drive wheelhouse, etc.

Open (or create) .gitignore in the repo and add patterns like:
########
# Python junk
__pycache__/
*.pyc
*.pyo
*.pyd
*.log

# Notebooks' noise
.ipynb_checkpoints/

# Virtual envs
env/
venv/
.venv/

# Data (adjust if you do want some tiny toy data committed)
data/qm9_raw/
data/qm9_processed/
data/*.npz
data/*.npy

# Checkpoints & runs
checkpoints/
runs/
*.pt
*.pth

# Wheel caches
wheelhouse/
*.whl

####
# then
git add .gitignore

####
3. See what you’re about to commit

Still in /home/crod569/QM9_project:
####
git status

####
Look at the “untracked files” / “modified” section and make sure it’s all things you want in the repo (e.g., env/setup_pyg_colab.py, eval_qm9_legacy.py, adjusted requirements.txt, etc.).

If you want to inspect actual changes:
#######
git diff             # changes in tracked files
git diff --stat      # summary (short)

######
4. Stage & commit your changes

To stage everything except what’s ignored:
######
git add .

#####
(If you want to be more careful, you can do git add file1 file2 ... instead.)

Then commit:
####
git commit -m "Tidy Colab env + PyG setup and QM9 baselines"

####
If git says “nothing to commit”, then there were no tracked changes—only untracked or ignored stuff.
####

5. Sync with remote safely (pull --rebase if needed)

First, see your remotes:
#####
git remote -v

####
You should see:
####
origin  git@github.com:zeugirdoR/QM9_project.git (fetch)
origin  git@github.com:zeugirdoR/QM9_project.git (push)

####
Now, before pushing, pull in anything new from GitHub (if any):
###
git pull --rebase origin main

###
If nothing changed on GitHub, this’ll just say “Already up to date.”

If there are changes, git may drop you into conflict resolution; fix those files, git add them, then:
####
git rebase --continue

####
Repeat until the rebase completes.

Check again:
####
git status

###
You want something like:
###
On branch main
nothing to commit, working tree clean
your branch is ahead of 'origin/main' by 1 commit.

####
6. Push your local state → GitHub

Now you can safely push:
####
git push origin main

####
If this is the first push for main you might already have:
###
git push -u origin main

####
(-u just sets upstream so later you can do plain git push / git pull).

After that, your GitHub repo will exactly mirror /home/crod569/QM9_project (minus ignored stuff).
####

7. Later: syncing from Colab back and forth

Once your pip install finishes on Colab and you’re ready to let Colab edit code too, the workflow becomes:

On Colab
####
%cd /content/QM9_project
!git pull   # get latest from laptop/GitHub

# ... edit files in Colab ...
!git status
!git add .
!git commit -m "Experiment: stable PyG env + sanity check notebook"
!git push

####
Back on laptop
####
cd /home/crod569/QM9_project
git pull    # brings in whatever you committed from Colab

####
And so on—always pull before you push if you’ve used both machines.
###
#########################
Saving the environment:
####
cd /home/crod569/QM9_project      # on laptop
# or: %cd /content/QM9_project    # on Colab

python env/print_qm9_env.py

#####
You should see a full summary: torch version, CUDA, GPU name, torch_geometric, scatter/sparse/cluster/spline-conv, numpy/scipy, plus the current git commit.

2. Commit it so every experiment knows its env

On your laptop:
####
cd /home/crod569/QM9_project
git add env/print_qm9_env.py
git commit -m "Add QM9 environment summary script"
git push

######
Then every time you start a new Colab session you can:
####
%cd /content/QM9_project
!git pull
!python env/print_qm9_env.py

#####
# not git but usefull....
How to use these wheels in a fresh runtime (later)

In a future Colab session, after mounting Drive and cloning/pulling your repo, you can install everything locally from Drive:
#######
from google.colab import drive
drive.mount("/content/drive")

WHEEL_DIR = "/content/drive/MyDrive/wheelhouse/cu126_torch2.9_pyg2.7"

!python -m pip install \
  --no-index --find-links="$WHEEL_DIR" \
  torch-scatter torch-sparse torch-cluster torch-spline-conv torch-geometric scipy

import torch, torch_geometric
print("torch:", torch.__version__)
print("torch_geometric:", torch_geometric.__version__)
