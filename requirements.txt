# requirements.txt
# Plan: once you have one “good” environment that actually trains, you run:
# pip freeze > requirements.txt
# and that becomes your canonical environment.
# From then on, any machine can recreate it with:
# pip install -r requirements.txt
# 
torch==2.9.0+cu126          # match your current Colab version
torchaudio==2.9.0+cu126     # optional, if present
torchvision==0.20.0+cu126   # optional

# PyG stack – use versions that actually work in your environment.
# For now, you can leave them unpinned until you know what works, then freeze.
